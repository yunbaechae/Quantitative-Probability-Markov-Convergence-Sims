# Quantitative Probability Analysis: Markov Inequalities and Convergence Simulations

STAT2372 Probability Assignment (2022)

This assignment covered advanced probability topics including Markov inequalities, convergence in probability and distribution, and rigorous empirical verification through Monte Carlo simulations in R.

## Key Tasks
- Derived improved tail probability bounds using Markov's inequality on transformed variables  
- Proved consistency and convergence properties with detailed mathematical steps  
- Conducted R simulations (set.seed(2048)) to empirically confirm theoretical results  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Probability theory (inequalities, convergence theorems, stochastic processes)  
- Mathematical proofs and analytical derivations  
- R programming for stochastic simulations and statistical validation  
- Quantitative risk and actuarial modelling foundations  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF (2372.pdf) is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all code chunks, outputs, proofs, and formatted results.)
